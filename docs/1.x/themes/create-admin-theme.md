title: Create a admin theme

# Create an new admin theme

In the Bagisto root directory go to the **config** folder and open `themes.php`.  
Now search for the keys `admin-default` and `admin-themes`. It will look like this,
  
```php
<?php
  return [
    'admin-default' => 'default',

    'admin-themes' => [
      'default' => [
        'views_path' => 'resources/admin-themes/default/views',
        'assets_path' => 'public/admin-themes/default/assets',
        'name' => 'Default'
      ]
    ]
  ];
```

| Key | Description|
| --- | ---------- |
| admin-default | is used to set the current theme. |
| admin-themes | is used to store a list of themes |
  
Now add one more theme into `admin-themes`.

```php
<?php
  return [
    'admin-default' => 'default',
    
    'admin-themes' => [
      'default' => [
        'views_path' => 'resources/admin-themes/default/views',
        'assets_path' => 'public/admin-themes/default/assets',
        'name' => 'Default'
      ],
        
      'theme1' => [
        'views_path' => 'resources/admin-themes/theme1/views',
        'assets_path' => 'public/admin-themes/theme1/assets',
        'name' => 'Theme 1'
      ]
    ]
  ];
```
    
As you see we have added the view and assets path in the `theme1` array.  
Now set your views and assets folder according to your mentioned path.

The resources structure will look like this,

~~~php
    - resources
      - admin-themes
        - theme1
          - views
~~~

Assets structure will look like this,

~~~php
    - public
      - admin-themes
        - theme1
          - assets
~~~

Now lets replace the dashboard page.  
Just create the exact dashboard's directory structure for `theme1` as present in `default`.  
So it will look like this,

~~~php
    - resources
      - admin-themes
        - theme1
          - views
            - dashboard
                - index.blade.php
~~~

Add some lines to the `index.blade.php`,

~~~php
    Theme 1 Sample
~~~

Now everything is setup. Just one thing is pending i.e. we need to activate the theme. So, for that we need to change the `admin-default` key in file `config/themes.php`.

~~~php
    ...
    'admin-default' => 'theme1',
    ...
~~~

Now check the dashboard page.

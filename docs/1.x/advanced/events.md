# Events
Events are an implementation of observer pattern such that whenever an event takes place, then one or more listener(s) associated with that event responds. Imagine something like making an announcement to your application, and then actions being taken due to that announcement. All the event classes in Bagisto are stored in the **Providers** folder and the listeners are stored in the **Listeners** folder.

## How to create Event Class?

If you have the Bagisto Package Generator installed, then you can use the following command which will create a new event class in `packages/ACME/TestPackage/src/Events` directory.

`php artisan package:make-event TestEvent ACME/TestPackage`

If event class already present then you can use force command for overwriting.

`php artisan package:make-event TestEvent ACME/TestPackage --force`

Or if you don't have package generator then, you can create file manually also.

## How to create Listener Class?

If you have the Bagisto Package Generator installed, then you can use the following command which will create a new listener class in `packages/ACME/TestPackage/src/Listeners` directory.

`php artisan package:make-listener TestListener ACME/TestPackage`

If listener class already present then you can use force command for overwriting.

`php artisan package:make-listener TestListener ACME/TestPackage --force`

Or if you don't have package generator then, you can create file manually also.

## Manually Registering Events

For the sake of simplicity, in bagisto, we register events manually in the boot method of your **_EventServiceProvider.php_** as below:

~~~php
/**
* Register any other events for your application.
*
* @return void
*/

public function boot()
{
    parent::boot();

    Event::listen('event.name', 'path-upto-listener@function');
}
~~~

## Manually Registering Listeners

In registering events, we specify listener function to be executed when an event is called so on every event a listener function is to be executed

~~~php
class EventServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    /**
    * Bootstrap services.
    *
    * @return void
    */
    public function boot()
    {
        Event::listen('checkout.order.save.after', 'Webkul\Admin\Listeners\Order@sendNewOrderMail');
    }
}
~~~

### How we specify events?

In most of **CRUD** operation, we had fired an event before and after the execution of function. So, that if some one want to perform any operation after or before product create/update/delete can perform by simply calling a listener function in event registration

## Events Fired in Bagisto

Events fired in bagisto but not listened such that if any user wants to perform any action on event fire, then they may create listener file and perform the respective operation.
